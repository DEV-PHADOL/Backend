EXPRESS.js Framework

INTRODUCTION to Express.js
-express is npm package
-framework
-manages everything from reciving the request and giving the response

ROUTE : 
remaining part other than domain is called as Route
for eg : www.youtube.com/profile
route : /profile , /about , /contactus
In route the req and res are the requestHandler

MIDDLEWARE : 
basically middle man between request and respond . when client request to the server and we want to perform a set of action before route that work middleware does. 
for eg : authentication, logging, data validation , etc
thus the above process middleware does 
app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    console.log("middleware");
    next();
});

ERROR HANDLING : 
Error Handling refers to how Express catches and processes errors that occur both synchronously and asynchronously. Express comes with a default error handler so you donâ€™t need to write your own to get started.

app.get("/about",function (req,res,next) {
    return next(new Error("SOMTHING WENT WRONG"));
});

app.use((err,req,res,next)=>{
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send('SOMTHING BROKE!');
});
